# Khaos Utilities
A discord bot developed for Khaos discord to do things we want it to do.
## Setup
1. Download [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (discord.js v12 needs node 12 and above!), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and git (optional).
2. Download the code through git (or download the zip)
```
git clone https://github.com/AI-nsley69/Khaos-Utilities.git
```
3. Download discord.js, ms, console and node-fetch through npm in the same folder as the rest of the files.
```
npm install discord.js@12 ms console node-fetch
```
4. Edit config.json, tags.json and commands.json to suit your needs
5. Change to the directory which houses the code and start it with node
```
node index.js
```
And you're set! If you have any questions, feel free to dm me (Ainsley#6969) on Discord o/
